# Documentation

This directory contains the framework documentation in both languages:

## 📄 Files

- **`framework-flow-en.md`** - English version (for GitHub repository)
- **`framework-flow-es.md`** - Spanish version (for thesis document)

Both files contain the same framework diagram and concepts, adapted for their respective audiences.

## 🌍 Language Strategy

- **English**: Maintains repository consistency and international accessibility
- **Spanish**: Provides material ready for academic thesis integration

The Mermaid diagrams are identical in structure but use language-appropriate labels and descriptions.
