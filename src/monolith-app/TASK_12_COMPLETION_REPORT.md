## Deployment Options

### 1. Local Production Testing

```bash
# Start complete production stack locally
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Access points:
# Application: https://localhost
# Grafana: http://localhost:3001
# Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
```

### 2. AWS EC2 Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to AWS EC2 with automated setup
VPC_ID=vpc-xxx SUBNET_ID=subnet-xxx ./deployment/deploy-aws.sh

# Includes:
# - Security group configuration
# - Instance provisioning
# - Application deployment
# - Monitoring setup
```

### 3. CI/CD Automated Deployment

- GitHub Actions pipeline for automated deployments
- Multi-environment support (staging/production)
- Quality gates with testing and security scanning
- Performance validation and rollback capabilities

## Monitoring Endpoints

### Application Health

- `/health` - Application health status
- `/metrics` - Prometheus metrics endpoint
- Application logs with structured formatting

### System Monitoring

- Grafana dashboard for real-time metrics
- Prometheus alerts for threshold violations
- CloudWatch integration for AWS services
- Log rotation and retention policies

## Security Measures

### Container Security

- Non-root user execution
- Minimal base image (Alpine Linux)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Regular security updates through CI/CD

### Network Security

- TLS encryption for all external traffic
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Internal network isolation
- Firewall rules and security groups

### Application Security

- JWT token validation
- API key authentication
- Input validation and sanitization
- Security headers implementation

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Management

- Container CPU and memory limits
- Database connection pooling
- HTTP keep-alive connections
- Static asset caching

### Monitoring and Tuning

- Response time tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Resource utilization alerts
- Performance baseline establishment

## Migration Validation

This production deployment configuration completes the AWS Lambda to IaaS migration framework by providing:

1. **Infrastructure as Code**: Reproducible deployment configuration
2. **Monitoring Parity**: Equivalent observability to AWS Lambda
3. **Security Standards**: Production-grade security implementation
4. **Scalability Framework**: Foundation for horizontal scaling
5. **Operational Excellence**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting

## Next Steps

With Task 12 completion, the migration framework provides:

- Complete application migration from FaaS to IaaS
- Production-ready deployment configuration
- Comprehensive testing and validation
- Monitoring and operational excellence
- CI/CD automation for ongoing maintenance

The PetStore application is now fully migrated and ready for production deployment on AWS IaaS infrastructure with enterprise-grade reliability, security, and observability.
