Analyze the FaaS application code within the 'faas-app' directory. Identify all API endpoints, their HTTP methods, path parameters, and expected request/response structures based on the Lambda function handlers (like Express.js routes). Generate a comprehensive OpenAPI 3.0 specification in YAML format. Ensure the specification includes:
1. Clear summaries and descriptions for each path and operation.
2. Definitions for path parameters (e.g., {id}).
3. Basic security scheme definitions (mentioning ApiKeyAuth and BearerAuth based on path prefixes like /admin).
4. Placeholder schema definitions for main data objects  even if details cannot be fully inferred.
5. Use standard HTTP status codes for responses (200, 201, 400, 403, 404, 500).
Output the result as openapi.yaml. Before generating, verify if an OpenAPI file already exists in the target directory.
